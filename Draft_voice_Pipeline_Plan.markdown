# Strategy for Advancing the Voice Pipeline

## Overview

The current voice pipeline faces rigidity, delays, poor voice handling, clunky agent transitions, weak error recovery, and maintenance challenges. The solution is a flexible, LLM-powered, streaming voice AI architecture prioritizing real-time adaptability, low latency, and voice-specific optimizations.

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Core Architecture Redesign

**Goal**: Build an adaptable, low-latency system for non-linear conversations and robust voice processing.

**Steps**:

- **Unify Agents**: Consolidate agents into one LLM-powered agent using context-aware memory (Redis) to reduce handoff errors.
- **Non-Linear Flows**: Enable dynamic rerouting for interruptions (e.g., user jumps to pricing) via intent detection.

**Tools/Frameworks**:

- **Grok 3 (xAI)**: Semantic understanding for complex dialogues.
- **ElevenLabs**: Low-latency TTS with dynamic tone.
- **Rasa**: Non-linear conversation flows.
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: Orchestrate LLM and tools.
- **Redis**: State persistence.

**Implementation**:

1. Initialize Rasa project and define stories for non-linear scenarios.
2. Use LangGraph for single-agent orchestration, storing state in Redis.
3. Deploy ElevenLabs TTS with rules for adaptive speed/tone based on user metadata.

### 2. Prototype

- Build a minimal pipeline for one use case (e.g., scheduling) using Rasa, Grok, and ElevenLabs.
- Test with simulated calls via Twilio or similar platforms.
